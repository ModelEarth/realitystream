## Interactive UX

To send parameters to the machine learning Colab notebook, we're building frontends for a backend Flask server.

1. Frontend (JavaScript): A web-based interface that allows users to trigger actions and interact with the workflow.
2. Backend (Flask or similar): A service to process requests from the frontend and execute the Colab notebook's logic.
3. Colab Notebook: A machine learning notebook hosted in Google Colab or converted into an executable Python script for integration.


## Projects

Replace TO DO with your name as you work on a project.  
Write Loren when you've submitted a pull request to show your name.  
Update related .ipynb and app.py file to also add your name.

1. DONE: Generate features-importance reports for available models - Melody and Yogesh.
2. DONE: Add a comparison process for accuracy reports into one table for viewing. - Melody
3. IN PROGRESS: Send files to Github - Yogesh

Additional TO DO's reside at the top of the [Run Models colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zu0WcCiIJ5X3iN1Hd1KSW4dGn0JuodB8?usp=sharing).


## Contribute to our Run Models Colab

[Run Models Colab](input/industries/)

PARTIALLY DONE: Add output files to the "[report](https://github.com/ModelEarth/reports/)" folder and add smart formatting in the index.html and javascript report display. We send it's content to GitHub in a step toward the end.

IN PROGRESS: Creating install for Flask application with Google Cloud Run cmds at [github.com/modelearth/cloud](https://github.com/modelearth/cloud)

TO DO: Additional dropdowns in frontend to customize parameters.yaml (industry year range, NAICS level 2 to 6, etc.)
https://github.com/ModelEarth/bee-data/tree/main/targets

TO DO: For a unified html report, as each model completes, update a dataset with the performance accuracy scores and other metrics for all the models, then send to a report.md file. Save in the left 'report' folder which we push to Github in last step.

TO DO: Fix the error: name 'save_dir' is not defined. - Is this still occuring?  
Occured previously for both rbf and xgboost. Maybe others.

TO DO: Test that default target path for bee data works by deleting in left panel after pullin in parameters.yaml. Then test that panels 15 and 16 work.  if param.targets.path: # Override with value from yaml  target_url = param.targets.path. Check if target_df has problems.

TO DO: Pull 2-column target zip code UN topics directly from Google Data Commons based DCID target value in parameters.yaml

TO DO: Add more parameters.yaml files that pull features/targets and join on the county Fips column. Add a path parameter that pulls from "all-years" which are generated by our [Industry Features CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HJnuilyEFjBpZLrgxDa4S0diekwMeqnh?usp=sharing). All years on GitHub:  
https://github.com/ModelEarth/community-timelines/tree/main/training/all-years
(These were created by Ronan)

TODO: Add a process that deletes the existing files in the colab environment which interfers with the code when we re-run

TODO: imblearn import for cuML - Check if already done.


### October 2025

Aryaman P - Moved parameter textbox widget near top of colab and custom steps to Forest Canopy.

Soham D - Repaired the Core GDC Data Function: Replaced the load_gdc_data_if_present function with a robust "V3" version that now correctly expands state geoIds into a full list of child counties and reliably pivots the data into the required wide format. - Soham 

Soham D - Resolved Data Mismatch Bugs: Implemented a fix in the data loading cell to standardize FIPS codes to a 5-digit string format across all data sources, solving the merge failures.

Soham D - Resolved Machine Learning Model Bugs: Fixed a ValueError in SMOTE by setting k_neighbors=4 to handle the small minority class in the training data, and resolved a AttributeError by making the feature importance extraction compatible with both cuML and scikit-learn model objects.

### September 2025 and prior

DONE: Include the time it took to run each model in report.md. - TARUN

DONE: Generate features-importance reports for available models. - Bin(Melody)

DONE: Performance metrics—including accuracy, ROC-AUC, G-Mean, best threshold, and classification reports—were aggregated into a modelResults dictionary using abbreviated keys. Top 10 feature importances for applicable models were included, and results were formatted into summary tables. - Yogesh Gajula

DONE: Function to calculate and append Correlation values to Unified Aggregation Results and Visual chart with prefix's for the top 10 Feature importances. - Yogesh Gajula

DONE Aashish: Used Pandas for integrated_df (became df) when save_training = False.  
 
DONE Tarun: Allow save-training to be set in the parameters.yaml values. Default to false. Use dash instead of underscore in yaml.

DONE Ivy: Accuracy report displayModelHeader to display the model name as header and the file paths for features and targets above the report. Parameter values below each path at the top of each accuracy report. So under the Feature path we'd have:  
startyear: 2017, endyear: 2021, naics: [6], state: ME

DONE Lily: Add support for multiple states. After running the third panel, you can edit the custom yaml on the right to set state: CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT.  Then add a loop that runs when there are multiple states. We'll add a file called parameters-new-england.yaml in the root of the RealityStream repo with the six states as features.states. Load here and add python to loop through the states.

DONE: Load blinks/parameters-blinks.yaml and use target.column to limit to y column

Done: Avoid sorting incoming parameters.yaml alphabetically. Attempt using  OrderedDict is commented out is several places below. Comment out prior alphabetical technique - we can provide a bool to toggle to it if it provides better security when requests are submitted through webpages. - Soham

DONE: Only import models requested by parameters.yaml. Move "from sklearn" imports to step after parameters are edited in textbox. - Tarun

DONE: Send the params loaded from the default path to the widget diplay. - Prathyusha

DONE: Create an object that holds the 5 sample parameters.yaml paths that are on the RealityStream main page. When choosing one, send the path and the yaml it points at to the textarea below the path select menu. - Prathyusha

DONE: Parameter files displayed in select menu. Instead pull the select options from parameter-paths.csv - Prathyusha

DONE: Deactivate the right-side display of the yaml values and have the editing occur in the widget textbox. - Melody
