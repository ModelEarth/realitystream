# Run Models Colab

**Our primary CoLab:**
Open the colab [Run Models](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zu0WcCiIJ5X3iN1Hd1KSW4dGn0JuodB8?usp=sharing) (Includes XGBoost) - Merges Features with Targets based on parameters.yaml
Backup resides at realitystream/models/Run-Models-bkup.ipynb

**GPU SUPPORT using cuML** In your browser, when using the Run Models notebook, change the runtime type to get the latest speedups from cuML.

Data prep for [Industry Features and Targets](../../../data-pipeline/timelines)

- Send report files to Github as last step in Run Models colab - DONE
- Fetch an index.html file from a Github link and send it to the report folder. - DONE

## Target Data

**External Targets (Google Data Commons)**

[Tree Canopy improvements](https://model.earth/data-commons/docs/conservation/), Improvements in [Emissions](https://model.earth/data-commons/docs/air/) by state and country, [Honey Bee Populations](../../../bee-data/).

Our [Geneate Industry Features Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HJnuilyEFjBpZLrgxDa4S0diekwMeqnh?usp=sharing) provides a simple sample of processing multiple years from [parameters.yaml](https://github.com/ModelEarth/realitystream/blob/main/parameters/parameters.yaml)  

**Industry Targets**

[Our Industry Targets Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dbB9RHaJba7AyiGbGugzpui5F9v4bJOQ?usp=sharing) for Job Growth and Wage Growth. - Data generated by [Industries Timeline Data Prep](../../../data-pipeline/timelines/prep/industries/)
